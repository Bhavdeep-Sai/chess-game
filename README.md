## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```env
   # MongoDB Configuration
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/chess_game
   # For MongoDB Atlas: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/chess_game

   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_in_production
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

   # Server Configuration
   PORT=3001
   NODE_ENV=development

   # CORS Configuration
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

   # Rate Limiting
   RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
   RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
   ```

4. Start MongoDB (if running locally):
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend will be running on `http://localhost:3001`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
   ```env
   # API Configuration
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
   VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001

   # Development
   VITE_NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:5173`
